"""
In this test, we construct three batteries, each of which have a "fast zone"
of charging; at 20% to 40%, 40% to 60%, and 60% to 80% respectively.

We also construct a test MOER forecast which has constant MOER except
a single interval in the middle where the MOER drops to zero.

We use the optimizer to get the schedule for each of these three batteries.
The schedules will be different: the optimizer wants to charge in the fast zone
during the zero MOER period. To do this, the battery with a later fast zone will
have to charge more before the zero MOER period. This behavior does indeed occur
and is shown in the output plot.
